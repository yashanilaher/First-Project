ID1110 Course Project
Jarvis (Virtual Assistant)

1.Introduction:
a) objective: to make a user-friendly interface for caring out a variety of tasks with well-defined commands. users can interact with the assistant through voice commands.
It aims to do the tasks like automating systems, searching data, monitoring.
c)Problem Statement: Developing an Intelligent Virtual Assistant System (Jarvis) for Efficient Task Automation and Personalized Assistance 
b) motivation: programming was new to us after coming here. we started programming here at end of 1st semester so we were waiting for such stuff(project)
and looking AI growing in these days. we felt like making a basic AI tool which is interactive with users. 

2.Project Overview:
a) project goals and scope: As we said earlier these days AI growth is fabulous. So, projects like this are never ending.
These is a basic tool what we have made but a complex thing containing computing technology, scientists and innovators are trying to develop a system that can 
think like a human. And who in this world will not like to have technology like this. And as python was new for each of us member, we were not 
able to learn machine learning in given time, so we were not able to add open AI.so, our goals will be to add stuffs like open AI in this after evaluation also.
b) Project Timeline: we people started searching ideas for our project nearly 18-20 days before. We decided to make this Jarvis on 19th May.

20th May: 
we made our GitHub accounts and searched on YouTube for various features that can be added to our Jarvis.
So many modules are used in Jarvis for various functions. So, we downloaded that and understood for what task which module is used.
We implemented code which is necessary for the Jarvis engine to get started with a voice (female or male)

21st May:
we added wish user function which wishes user depending on current time and date with the help of datetime module. 
We implemented code which took commands from user and converted it into strings.
we added a function which takes command from user and coverts it into a string.
We added code which can open various websites like YouTube, google, Spotify, Facebook, google maps.

22nd May:
We added a new feature of sending a mail with given password and emailed of sender and the one who will receive have to put his email in text file provided.

24th May:
We tried to add a feature of sending message on WhatsApp to any person we want. 
But it was bit difficult so we tried to send message to selected person but in that also when WhatsApp was opening it was not logging up so we need to
skip that idea

26th May:
Now we thought that can we open YouTube and google and can we search the results that we want. so, we implement features like this.
so just we need to speak some keywords (for e.g. If while speaking if google search is used then it will play, then it will search on google whatever we want.

27th May:
We added simple features like playing music, telling time ,repeating what user said .

28th May:
We searched a little what more can we add more so we got an idea how can we automate YouTube.
so, we did that also automated google with various functions using module keyboard

30th May:
we login to our GitHub ids and started uploading what we have done earlier. we then added a feature thru which Jarvis will tell us a joke.

2nd June:
We searched more and then we implemented a code due to which we can get a meaning, synonym, antonym of a word we want using PyDictionary module. 
Also added function which will take screenshot of current page and save it in a file, also can click the photo of user.

3rd June:
We wanted the code to be good so we wanted to add some interface. so 1st we used Qt designer and added some gifsin that and also converted that 
is code but we were not able to fix it with our code. so we tried to use tkinter to make the interface then 
from YouTube using gif and adding some music to that using pygame.

d) Team Members and Contributions:

group no: F 13
1)Yash Anil Aher: searched and added various features like sending mail, searching whatever we want on YouTube and made interface
2)Prichand: gave idea of making Jarvis and coded features like automating YouTube, clicking photo, taking screenshot and also helped in making interface 
3)Kanikella Pramod Sai: automated google and coded for getting meaning, synonym and antonym of word, opening various websites, playing music.

3) Methodology:
a) Approach and Methodology employed: identifying tasks it needs to automate, the types of queries it should handle, additional features,
keyword-based lookup/codes to identify intent behind the command.Defining overall process containing components as user interface, 
command processing, data retrieval and response generation.
b) Tools, Technologies, and frameworks use: imported pyttsx3, speech recognition, datetime, Wikipedia, web browser, os, random, smtplib, pywhatkit,
pyautogui, keyword, pyjokes, PyDictionary modules and used tkinter for making interface
	
4) Conclusion and Future work:

a) Summary of Outcomes and contribution: The Jarvis assistance can automate routine tasks such as sending mails, performing predefined actions
based on user commands. The Jarvis assistance can effectively interpret user commands.it can feature a user friendly interface such as voice 
recognition system, enabling user to interact seamlessly and receive responses to their queries.
This project was possible due to all members working together. the interface and 40% coding was done by Yash Aher, 30% coding was done by prichand and Pramod Sai.
And each member contributed in searching for features that can be added and report.
b) Assessment of project success: during making this project we learn many technical things as well as things related to programming.
We are also thinking to continue this project afterwards by adding things like open AI in it.
c)Lessons learned and recommendations for future improvements: during making of this project, we got to learn about different modules and their uses. 
we also learned many technical things like adding gifs or images and giving it a sound .in this path we worked a bit on Qt designer also which was not successful.
we can improve in future by making it more efficient by implementing machine learning in it.
